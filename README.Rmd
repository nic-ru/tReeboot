## Description

**heaRt** is an R package for analyzing and modelling clinical data
related to heart disease diagnosis.

The package downloads and processes the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, allows the user to select
relevant clinical variables, fits different statistical and machine
learning models, and produces informative plots of the fitted results.

Three functions are provided:

1.  `load_heaRt()`: downloads the heart disease dataset, filters
    observations according to diagnosis severity, and returns a tidy
    object of class "heaRt",

2.  a `fit()` method: for fitting predictive models (decision trees,
    logistic regression, random forests, and linear regression) to
    "heaRt" objects. The user can choose whether to fit models with one
    or two predictors,

3.  and a `plot()` method for producing nice visualisations depending on
    the fitted model (decision tree plots, partial dependence plots, or
    regression curves) based on`ggplot2`.

Typically, these functions are applied sequentially. A demonstration of
the typical workflow of the `heaRt` package follows below.

## Installation

You can install the development version of heaRt from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("nic-ru/heaRt")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## library(heaRt)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
