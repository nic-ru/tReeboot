## Introduction

The **heaRT** package provides a framework for loading, modelling, and visualising heart disease data. The package is built around three main functions:

1.  `load_heaRt()`: data acquisition and information filtering,

2.  `fit()`: model fitting,

3.  `plot()`: visualisation of fitted models.

Typically, these functions are applied sequentially.
