\title{Fit statistical and machine learning models to heart disease data}
\usage{
fit(
  obj,
  num_var = c("1", "2"),
  fit_type = c("decision.tree", "logistic.reg", "random.forest", "lm"),
  consider_first = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\description{
Fits decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, or linear
regression models to heart disease data. The function automatically
constructs the appropriate model formula based on the selected options,
removing the need for manual specification by the user.
}
\details{
Fits several statistical and machine learning models to heart disease
data previously loaded with \code{\link{load_heaRt}}. The response
variable is the binary diagnosis indicator \code{y}, while one or two
clinical predictors are used as explanatory variables.

The function is implemented as an S3 generic, with a dedicated method
for objects of class \code{"heaRt"}.
}
\note{
A dedicated \code{\link[=plot.heaRt_fit]{plot}} method is provided for
objects of class \code{"heaRt_fit"}, which produces model-specific
visualisations.
}
\examples{
dat <- load_heaRt(vars = "rbp-restECG")

# Fit different models to the same data
mod1 <- fit(dat, num_var = "2", fit_type = "decision.tree")
mod2 <- fit(dat, num_var = "2", fit_type = "random.forest")
mod3 <- fit(dat, num_var = "1", fit_type = "lm")
mod4 <- fit(dat, num_var = "2",
            fit_type = "logistic.reg",
            consider_first = FALSE)
